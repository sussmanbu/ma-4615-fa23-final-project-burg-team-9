### Driving Under the Lens: Uncovering the Truth Behind Racial Disparities in Montgomery County's Traffic Arrests


Imagine yourself in your car, heading home from work at 7:30 PM. The dark, rainy evening sets the stage for a distressing scene on the highway: a Toyota Corolla, swerving dangerously, eventually collides with a BMW M4. Such an incident in Montgomery County, Maryland, might prompt assumptions about the driver's race. However, our in-depth analysis seeks to move beyond stereotypes to understand the true nature of racial disparities in traffic-related arrests. Our thesis statement is that non-white populations of Montgomery County, Maryland have more instances of traffic violations when compared to areas of the county that are predominantly white. 

Figure 1. Map of proportion of race by block group for Montgomery County. P1_003N = White alone, P1_004N = Black or African American alone, P1_005N = American Indian and Alaska Native alone, P1_006N = Asian alone, P1_007N = Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander alone. As we can see from these maps, Montgomery country is predominantly white. 

Figure 2. Map of proportion of race by block group plus location of traffic violations and crash reports in Montgomery county. The traffic violations and crash reports seemed to be concentrated towards the areas with lower proportions of White people. Blue = traffic violation (n = 933451), pink = collision (n = 95020). The overwhelming majority of reports are traffic violations. 

Figure 3. Map of traffic violations (blue) and crash reports (pink). There is a lot of overlap between where the two occur. 

From the maps above, we see an arresting pattern: a disproportionate number of traffic arrests occur in areas predominantly inhabited by people of color. This visual evidence, represented by clusters of dots marking arrest locations, suggests a troubling trend of racial disparities.

Our investigation focuses on the layers behind these patterns. We analyze the types of violations, the time of day, demographic characteristics, and external factors like weather and traffic patterns. This comprehensive approach helps us uncover whether these disparities are due to systemic issues, such as biases in law enforcement practices, or other socioeconomic or geographic conditions.

Our study is more than a collection of statistics; it is an ethical inquiry into the dynamics of race and law enforcement. We are committed to responsible data analysis, ensuring our findings are objective and sensitive to the social implications. Our goal is to challenge preconceived notions and provide evidence-based insights into the nature of traffic-related arrests in Montgomery County.

Ultimately, this analysis is not just about numbers; it's about people and the communities they live in. By shedding light on these disparities, we aim to inform more equitable policing practices and contribute to a fairer legal system. Our research is a step towards understanding and addressing the complex realities of racial disparities in traffic violations, paving the way for a more just society.
