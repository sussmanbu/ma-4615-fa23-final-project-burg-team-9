This comes from the file `big_picture.Rmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will



* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.


Title: Driving Under the Lens: Uncovering the Truth Behind Racial Disparities in Montgomery County's Traffic Arrests

Complete Thesis:
Imagine yourself in your car, heading home from work at 7:30 PM. The dark, rainy evening sets the stage for a distressing scene on the highway: a Toyota Corolla, swerving dangerously, eventually collides with a BMW M4. Such an incident in Montgomery County, Maryland, might prompt assumptions about the driver's race. However, our in-depth analysis seeks to move beyond stereotypes to understand the true nature of racial disparities in traffic-related arrests.

Figure 1. Map of proportion of race by block group for Montgomery County. P1_003N = White alone, P1_004N = Black or African American alone, P1_005N = American Indian and Alaska Native alone, P1_006N = Asian alone, P1_007N = Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander alone. As we can see from these maps, Montgomery country is predominantly white. 

Figure 2. Map of proportion of race by block group plus location of traffic violations and crash reports in Montgomery county. The traffic violations and crash reports seemed to be concentrated towards the areas with lower proportions of White people. Blue = traffic violation (n = 933451), pink = collision (n = 95020). The overwhelming majority of reports are traffic violations. 

Figure 3. Map of traffic violations (blue) and crash reports (pink). There is a lot of overlap between where the two occur. 

Montgomery County's demographics show a diverse population: 48.85% White, 18.4% Black or African American, 15.19% Asian, and others comprising the remaining percentage. But these figures don't tell the whole story. Through the lens of Hollyâ€™s detailed map, we see an arresting pattern: a disproportionate number of traffic arrests occur in areas predominantly inhabited by people of color. This visual evidence, represented by clusters of dots marking arrest locations, suggests a troubling trend of racial disparities.

Our investigation focuses on the layers behind these patterns. We analyze the types of violations, the time of day, demographic characteristics, and external factors like weather and traffic patterns. This comprehensive approach helps us uncover whether these disparities are due to systemic issues, such as biases in law enforcement practices, or other socioeconomic or geographic conditions.

Our study is more than a collection of statistics; it is an ethical inquiry into the dynamics of race and law enforcement. We are committed to responsible data analysis, ensuring our findings are objective and sensitive to the social implications. Our goal is to challenge preconceived notions and provide evidence-based insights into the nature of traffic-related arrests in Montgomery County.

Ultimately, this analysis is not just about numbers; it's about people and the communities they live in. By shedding light on these disparities, we aim to inform more equitable policing practices and contribute to a fairer legal system. Our research is a step towards understanding and addressing the complex realities of racial disparities in traffic violations, paving the way for a more just society.
